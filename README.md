Deployment Instructions
To deploy the ACE system, you will need three computers:
    Main Computer:  Capture images from the car kit and sends them to the two auxiliary computers. The main computer will also identify the lane in the images.
    Auxiliary Computer 1: Receives images from the main computer and detect signs and send information back to the main computer.
    Auxiliary Computer 2: Receives images from the main computer and detect vehicles and send information back to the main computer.
Note: 
    *The main computer will aggregate the information from both auxiliary computers and send control commands to the AutoCar kit.
    *All computers must connect to the same Wifi

Start the System:
    Start the main computer with the Lap 3 file.
    Start Auxiliary Computer 1 with the Lap 8 file.
    Start Auxiliary Computer 2 with the Lap 9 file.

Notes
    Ensure all computers are connected to the network and have the necessary permissions.
    Check configurations and parameters before starting the system to avoid unexpected issues.
